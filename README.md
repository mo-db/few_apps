In this Repo i write little applications using my knowledge of programming languages, frameworks, api`s and libraries.
I am using AI (Claude and ChatGPT) to help me quickly grasp new concepts, debug my code, help me with syntax of languages that Im not proficient in.
But I try for the most time to limit myselfe just copying code from AI because I also wanna grasp the deep underlying concepts.

AI just feels a little to powerfull allready, especially Claude 3.5
I am constantly bothered by the fact that most concepts/problems i try to grasp and implement, I could also just ask AI to do and maybe have to debug it a bit to have it working.
But this way I will learn way less and my abilities wont improve much. 

APPS:
  - clip_manager: a clipboard manager with custom ui, using SDL2 for that and also to send audio buffers of sound effect wav files
  -
